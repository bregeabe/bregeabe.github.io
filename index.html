        <h3>More about me</h3>
        I have professional experience with <b>Python</b>, <b>React Native</b>, and <b>React.js</b>, research experience
        with
        <b>Smalltalk</b>,
        and other projects / academic experience with <b>Racket</b>, <b>C++</b>, and <b>Java</b>.
        <br /><br />
        I am currently a <b>Full Stack Web Developer</b> at <a href="https://northcrossgroup.com" target="_blank"
          class="link">Northcross Group</a>. While this doesn't apply directly to my future research interests, I enjoy
        software engineering at large, and find any way I can to improve not only my development, but my problem solving
        and collaboration skills as well.
        <br /><br />
        Previously, I was an <b>Engineering Intern</b> at <a href="https://www.syncurrent.com/" target="_blank"
          class="link">Syncurrent</a>, where I helped design and implement a scraper architecture in <b>Python</b> that
        gathered, parsed, and analyzed large sets of data to bring funding to small governments and tribes.

      In my free time, I enjoy playing <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/abrege11" target="_blank" class="link">chess</a>, golfing, and all of the other fun things you can do in Marquette, Michigan
      like hiking, snowboarding, cliff jumping, and disc golfing to name a few.

              Implementing a compiled, modular version of Smalltalk. I was a part of MT during the push for making it
              platform agnostic. This meant working on MTBootstrap, MTDevtools and other aspects of self-compilation,
              primarily developing in groups of four.

                <p>A simulator geared towards lowering the barrier to entry for aspiring students who wish to get
                  involved
                  in quantum information science. PQCV currently supports the Hadamard, Phase shift, and Pauli
                  operations on a single
                  qubit. The kick is the animation of the qubit changing state across the screen in real time, along
                  with
                  multiple mathematical representations at the bottom, accompanied by an interactive bloch sphere
                  showing
                  the current state vector. Originally created for myself, my goal now is to continue development to
                  support mutli-qubit operations and gates.</p>

                  error
                  checker. This language supports features such as conditionals, loops, procedures, functions, complex

                <p>Serpent is like Strava for programmers. It tracks your coding activity on websites like GitHub and
                  Leetcode and allows you to create your own projects for a personalized feel. On top of that, it
                  introduces the aspect of time, a concept not typically associated with coding. By visualizing your
                  coding activity over time, Serpent helps you identify patterns and trends in your development.</p>
